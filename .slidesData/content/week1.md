# Andrew's Rant

{{% section %}}

* CTF
  * Find flags, get points
  * Finding 6843 flags, no points ... for now
  * Finding 6843 flags, feel good about yourself
  * Finding 6843 flags, get more out of the course without the stress of being assessed

* Vulnerability Report
  * Groups of 4 / 5
  * More about this in the future...
  * For now, keep track of how you found flags
